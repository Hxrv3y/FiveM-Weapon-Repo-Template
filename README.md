Hello, this is a simple template to make it easier to make your weapon folders and keep them as organised as possible

Step 1: Add the Weapons folder to you fivem server and go to your server.cfg and add (Rename this folder if you want)

ensure Weapons

Step 2: Go into the stream folder and make a new folder in there that correlates to the weapon for example. AWP Dragon Lore. From that add the stream files into the folder. Make sure it's a simple file name as this will be the weapon spawn name for example for an AWP Dragon Lore name it something like awpdlore.

Step 3: Go to the data folder and name the folder the exact same as the one from the stream folder. This isn't nessacary however, makes it a lot more organised when wanting to find the weapon to tweak or replace it.

Step 4: Go into weaponNames and add the weapons spawn name in the WEAPON_ after the _ and inside the quotations add the Weapon name you want to appear on the weapon wheel as that is what that script does

Step 5: Go in game and test.

Hope this helped
